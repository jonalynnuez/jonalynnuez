          <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 16px;">They say everyone in this world is unique, maybe with their physical appearance or their personality, and everyone like their uniqueness <br> but I don't like mine. Yes, I am a responsible and empathic person however I am a dependent person as well, I cannot do things all on my <br>own and that trait of mine is my hatest.
I am Jonalyn Nuez, a twenty-year-old student currently enrolled at Isabela State University-Ilagan <br>Campus pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Mangcuram City of Ilagan, Isabela. My father is a <br>farmer, and my mother is now in paradise with the Almighty God, I am their firstborn, and I have a younger sister we are only 1 year <br> apart she is studying at Isabela State University- Cauayan Campus pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education.<br> My hobbies are reading Wattpad stories, watching Kdrama, and playing online games. Reading Wattpad stories gives me peace <br>of mind and improves my spelling. I love reading Wattpad stories because it is a great thing to do, and imagination is better than reality. <br>Another hobby of mine is watching K-Dramas. It gives me a way to treat my stress and depression, and my one more hobby is playing <br> online games because it gives me an immersive experience and requires strategy and problem-solving skills to win a game. <br> Whoever I am today is because of my family. At every point in my life, I always receive their motivation. They encourage me even if I fail <br> sometimes. I am a responsible person and I do what I am supposed to do, not because I want to but because needed to because I am the eldest.<br> As of right now, I am a student, so I complete my homework every day and prepare for my classes. Most of the time, I pay attention in my <br> online class. Along with it, I also organize my job. I also help my parents because with household chores like doing laundry and <br>washing dishes. Because it is my duty as the eldest daughter to do so, I also tidy my room once a week. When my friends and <br>classmates need aid, I assist them as well. I give out advice and suggestions to them when they need support and help as well. Generally,<br> I can say that I am a responsible person who does my duties. Besides being a responsible person, I am also an empathic person.<br> Because I'm very curious about the life of people around me. I try to learn a lot about people so, in this way, I study their characters <br> before I react. I know that I am not perfect and I never try to be but one thing is true I am who I am. Even in my school days, I was always <br> motivated by my friends to discover also myself. So, I can say that I am pretty satisfied with the people surrounding me and I'm grateful <br> to God for giving me a supportive ambiance altogether in my life. Finding out what life genuinely has in store for you is more <br>important than always whining about what you haven't received from it. Every person has potential, and it is up to us how we use it.<br> We weave the past into the future to create a lovely pattern.
I constantly look forward to the freedom warriors as my role models and aspire <br> to be like them. My motivation comes from the zeal, vigor, and vitality with which they overcame obstacles in their lives and improved <br>the world as we know it now. Therefore, how we master ourselves will determine how wonderful our future will be,<br> and I believe this. I wish all of my pals the best of luck.</p>
