She is kind and <br>beautiful, and I love her so much.</p>

                <p style="color: white;">Jonalyn is that kind of friend who never <br> gets tired advising whether it's <br> about school, modern life, or love life.<br> We share the same presuppositions in <br>terms of friendship thus we only argue once <br>in a while. I love her and she loves me,<br> that's what makes us bestfriends.</p>
